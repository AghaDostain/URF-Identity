# URF-Identity
An ASP.net 2.2 implementation using the Generic Unit of Work and Repositories Framework

This project uses Long Le's elegant [Unit of Work & (extensible/generic) Repositories Framework](http://genericunitofworkandrepositories.codeplex.com/) to manage the Data Access Layer for Microsoft's ASP.NET Identity 2.2.1 implementation.

The project was built from the standard Visual Studio MVC application with external class libraries used to define:

* The POCO application models (including the customised Identity models)
* The Generic Unit of Work and Repositories Framework
* The cusomised ASP.NET Identity implementation
* The Data Access layer (DAL)
